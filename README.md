# Wi-fi-Car
This car can be controlled using mobile phone (with the use of wi-fi), I have used node-MCU and node_MCU motor driver shield to make this car. You can see the connections and code later in this project page.

<br>
I have made this car using node-MCU (ESP-12E) module, node-MCU motor shield, and two uxcell DC micro motor with encoder and speed measurement( you can also use DC 3V-6V Single Axis Gear Reducer Motor, as I have not used encoder and speed measurement part of it).
